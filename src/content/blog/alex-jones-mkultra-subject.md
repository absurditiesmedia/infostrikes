An unrelated Freedom of Information Act request led our investigators to discover that Alex Jones, prior to his career as an investigative journalist, had been a subject in the government’s infamous M.K. Ultra program. Further reports suggest that he may currently be employed by the C.I.A. as part of their propaganda dissemination team.

Jones’ InfoWars website gained notoriety in the previous decade for releasing shocking claims about the events of 9/11. More recently, it's been known for its stance on the Democratic Party and leftist activist groups like Antifa. It seems almost implausible that such wild claims could benefit the powers that be, but if you've ever watched an episode of Game of Thrones or House of Cards, you probably have an idea of how chess-like political games can be.

“And that's just it,” says a senior political analyst for infoSTRIKES. “Politicians are usually ten steps ahead of the general public, always looking for a new tragedy to politicize for their agenda. And since we only have a vague understanding of what exactly their agendas are, it's often difficult to see what the endgame is until years later.”
