A confidential source recently contacted infoSTRIKES with a shocking revelation about the antivaxxer movement. It turns out that British doctor and de facto father of the modern anti-vaccine movement, Andrew Wakefield, received a large sum of money from McNeil Consumer Healthcare prior to his 1998 study, "Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine: Through a dark glass, darkly." McNeil Consumer Healthcare is the manufacturer of Tylenol, which is the only known drug to help with the symptoms of all three: measles, mumps, and rubella.

This is not the only known conflict of interest for Dr. Wakefield. His UK medical license was revoked in 2004 when The General Medical Council, an independent regulator for doctors in the UK, found that Wakefield had been hired by a law board to find evidence supporting a litigation case by parents who believed the vaccine had harmed their children. In 2010, after the British General Medical Council ruled against Wakefield, the paper was retracted by its original publisher, The Lancet.

This revelation is further evidence of the decline of the medical field as a whole. It should be obvious to anyone paying attention that doctors are no longer in the business of healing the sick, but rather in the business of lining their pockets. Pharmaceutical companies are paying kickbacks and sending doctors on drug-fueled romps through exotic locations. Visit any golf course in Florida, and you’ll see doctors nodded out on oxycontin, some lying in their own vomit.

We spoke with an escort from Tampa, Florida, who wished to remain anonymous about her experience with clients from the medical field in recent years.

“I’d say it started around 2006. Up until then, doctors acted the way you might expect. Aside from their penchant for really weird things, which I suppose you would expect from doctors, they generally behaved like, well, doctors, you know? But increasingly, they show up high, mostly on opiates, but sometimes I can’t even tell. I’ve started carrying Narcan with me after one of my clients lost his medical license when I dropped him off at the hospital after he ODed on me. It seems like at least twice a week now, I need to revive some messed-up doctor.”

Wakefield was contacted for comment but declined to respond. Aside from being another indicator of guilt, his silence tells us that he does not take his position as a doctor seriously. The first rule doctors follow is to do no harm. He has already broken that rule. Another thing doctors value is their responsibility to the public. They are supposed to be on the front lines, studying threats to the public and coming up with solutions. If he does not respond to efforts to contact him, how is he holding himself accountable to the public?

It comes as no surprise to anyone paying attention that doctors are more concerned with scratching each other's backs than keeping the public healthy. By working together to make the public more likely to contract deadly diseases, these doctors have found a way to sell more products such as Tylenol. Tylenol, which can lead to a whole host of deadly side effects and complications, requires further treatment through expensive medical procedures.
