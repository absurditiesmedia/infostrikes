The FDA recently issued a warning about the dangers of *Mitragyna speciosa*, an Indonesian plant commonly known as kratom. Kratom has been used for centuries by individuals seeking to free themselves from opiate addiction. The FDA claims that from 2010 to 2015, 36 deaths have been loosely associated with kratom, but a direct causal link has not been firmly established.

Amidst calls to regulate or ban kratom, one must ponder the motivations behind these actions. Currently, there are limited accepted treatments for opiate addiction in the United States. The most prevalent therapies are methadone and suboxone, both of which are expensive, patented, and necessitate long-term use. Years ago, Howard Lotsof discovered that ibogaine, derived from the African iboga root, effectively interrupts addiction. However, ibogaine was swiftly classified as a Schedule I illegal substance. Now, with declining sales of methadone and suboxone in recent years, the FDA and DEA are moving to ban kratom. Draw your own conclusions.

The American Kratom Association is actively lobbying against these efforts. For more information on their advocacy, visit their website at [www.americankratom.org](http://www.americankratom.org).
